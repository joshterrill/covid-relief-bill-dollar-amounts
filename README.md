# COVID Relief Bill Money

This repository attempts to parse the December 21, 2020 COVID relief bill, looking for references to dollar amounts spent and saving them to markdown files. Currently there are 2 markdown files, one containing sections of text that reference all dollar amounts (`referenced-dollars.md`), and another which references specific dollar amounts that are being given to outside-countries (`referenced-countries.md`).

**This is a work in progress. Pull requests are welcome.**

A PDF hosted version of the original text can be found on the house website: https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf

And the text version that I use can be found in this repo under `bills-116hr133sa-rcp-116-68.txt`
